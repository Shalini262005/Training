RCB's last win and MI's last defeat here came in the second Qualifier in 2011 when RCB beat MI by 43 runs.
How did Mumbai Indians form such a solid team? Former Proteas Performance Analyst, Prasanna Agoram - fondly known as PDogg - helps us understand their success mantra through this exclusive on Cricbuzz Plus.
Teams:
Mumbai Indians (Playing XI): Rohit Sharma(c), Chris Lynn, Suryakumar Yadav, Ishan Kishan(w), Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Rahul Chahar, Marco Jansen, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah
Royal Challengers Bangalore (Playing XI): Virat Kohli(c), Rajat Patidar, AB de Villiers(w), Glenn Maxwell, Daniel Christian, Washington Sundar, Kyle Jamieson, Harshal Patel, Mohammed Siraj, Shahbaz Ahmed, Yuzvendra Chahal
Rohit: Would've fielded first as well. But as a team we've batted well over the years. Nothing different for us. Bat well in the powerplay and set the game up for the big hitters. The entire square has been changed. Recently played a couple of Tests. Need to do what we do as a team, put our best foot forward. For us it's a fresh year, don't need to look at what's happened in the past. Fresh year, new faces as well. Important for us to start well which we haven;t done in this tournament. Last game we played was a final in Dubai. Got only two changes from that lineup. Quinny is in quarantine, so he isn't available. Lynn will make debut. And we have a six foot eight inch South African, Marco Jensen.
Kohli: It's unbelievable, bit of a mini break helped me I guess to win a toss. Going to bowl first. They're a side who likes chasing. Good chance for us to get onto the park and create some intensity. With the balance we have this year we can do both, but have to understand who you're playing against. We understand with the depth they have they have never out of the game. Bowling first was a no-brainer for us. Every year IPL has a different energy, a different vibe. It's high intensity. Playing for the same franchise has been an honour for me. Loyalty is a big thing for me. Dubai was great as well but this just feels like home. Great feeling to be playing in our stadiums and for people to watch in our prime times. Three guys making their debut: Maxwell, Jamieson, Christian is back after eight years for the same franchise. Rajat Patidar makes his debut as well. Padikkal has been recommended rest.
Royal Challengers Bangalore have won the toss and have opted to field
""When I look at this ground, feels deceptively small but it isn't. Test match pitch was totally different. This one looks a lot better. New ball will come on to the bat nicely, but the problem will arrive once the ball gets old. Once the spinners come into play, there will be a lot of deviation,"" reckons L Sivaramakrishnan along with Danny Morrison in the pitch report.
6.40pm local: For those asking, looks like de Kock won't be part of the team today for MI. In fact, Chris Lynn has been handed his cap by Rohit Sharma. There's also a surpise debut lined up for Marco Jansen, a 20-year old left-arm pacer from South Africa.
6.30pm local: RCB played the season opener at Chepauk in 2019, and were bowled out for a shocking 70 runs. The pitch this time though is expected to be more sporting. In general, however, spinners should be a much happier bunch with the tournament coming back to India. It will be interesting to see how Mumbai, traditionally a pace-heavy outfit, cope with it, given their pacers won't have the comforts of the Wankhede to rely on either.
6.15pm local: New picks, record buys, neutral venues, new captains - all of this will be part of the flavour of this year's IPL. But will this new flavour also entail Mumbai Indians breaking the trend of losing season openers? They're up against the Royal Challengers Bangalore today, a team they've historically done very well against. ""The journey of Mumbai Indians though has come to a point where there are more ghosts to fear in the Indian Premier League opener than in the final. Several of their players have laughed off the thought of what ails them in the first stop and suggest that the winless run since 2012 is beyond their understanding,"" Aayush Puthran writes in the preview below.
5.45pm IST: There's a lot riding on this tournament for the players as they gear up for the T20 World Cup later this year. A final chance to really smash the door down for those on the outside: the likes of Prithvi Shaw, R Ashwin, Sanju Samson among others. Players not in form, like KL Rahul, will be desperate to regain it. And the focus will be to stay away from injuries as well. What're your predictions for the player to watch out for this time around. Go ahead, tell us in the comments that've now been enabled.
But in the times we're living in, the IPL does come as a much-needed respite for many. TV figures for the 2020 edition were through the roof, with nearly half of India's audience tuning into the competition. Fingers crossed this season runs as smoothly as that one did, although it's going to be a hell of a challenge over the next couple of months. Anyway, thanks for joining us today. This is Sagar Chawla welcoming you to our live coverage as we get ready for everything that the cricket has to offer.
5.30pm IST: Hello to everyone joining in early for a whole new season of the IPL. Only around five months since the night when Mumbai Indians lifted their .. fifth, was it? .. trophy, the tournament is back again, raising anticipation levels and scoffing at the very idea of viewer fatigue. And it's back home too as it returns from the UAE where it had been moved last year due to the pandemic. The threat of Covid-19 has gone nowhere though. It has only intensified in the form of a second wave that's hit India hard these last few weeks. Concerns have been growing along with the tally of positive cases in and around the IPL; spectators, who briefly made a return, are once again banned from stadiums; the tournament itself will follow a caravan format across six cities; and, of course, there are the intricately layered bio-bubbles that franchises have to contend with.
Preview by Aayush Puthran

Rohit Sharma vs Virat Kohli - is as much a Friday blockbuster can offer in the times of lockdowns and OTTs.

Beyond the marketing gimmicks and fan-club pleasing scheduling though, comes a highly valued cricket match between two teams - one that aims to strengthen its legacy and the other that wishes to halt it.

The journey of Mumbai Indians though has come to a point where there are more ghosts to fear in the Indian Premier League opener than in the final. Several of their players have laughed off the thought of what ails them in the first stop and suggest that the winless run since 2012 is beyond their understanding. What Mumbai Indians would be out to fix in the tournament opener, is what Royal Challengers Bangalore would be doing with respect to their fortunes in the competition: try to figure out what is going wrong!

While the defending champions have retained their core unit, RCB spent big bucks at the 2021 auction to acquire the services of Glenn Maxwell and Kyle Jamieson to strengthen them further. Yet, much like most of the seasons, where they seemed to have assembled a strong squad, the winning formula is yet to be discovered.

Mumbai Indians’ second-best win percentage is against RCB (among all teams against whom they have played more than six matches), and yet despite their dominance, Virat Kohli’s side managed to run them close twice last year and even become one of only three teams to beat MI’s full-strength XI.

A good reason for their dominance has come at the back of being able to control Kohli in recent years. The RCB skipper hasn’t managed to break free easily against the five-time champions and the challenge will get stiffer in Chennai, where his scoring rate has only been 111.49. AB de Villiers though enjoys his time in Chepauk, where he has scored 228 runs at a strike rate of 152. What’s to be expected out of their new recruit Maxwell remains unknown, not just for his unpredictability but also because he is yet to play at the venue.

Despite MI’s recent dominance in Chennai, their top-order hasn’t enjoyed a good run either. They can, however, rely more on their least appreciated front - the spin department. Krunal Pandya and Rahul Chahar have conceded runs at marginally over 4 every six balls. But much like RCB’s quest to find answers, MI too have reasons to wonder: in the vast pool of talent and ideas, is there enough to break the first-match jinx?

What to expect: Even as Chennai has traditionally played slow and helped the spinners, the tournament opener is the flattest pitch that is likely to be on offer this season. However, with neither team boasting of a top-class spin attack, mid-range scores could be on the cards.

When: Friday, April 9, 2021, 7:30 PM IST

Where: Mumbai Indians vs Royal Challengers Bangalore, Chennai

Team News:

Mumbai Indians: Although Quinton de Kock has taken a bubble to bubble transfer from South Africa, MI have stated on their website that a new opening pair will feature on Friday. Mumbai Indians could be tempted to break away from their set format and play an additional spinner, especially given Virat Kohli and AB de Villiers’ ailings against leggies.

Probable XI: Ishan Kishan (wk), Rohit Sharma, Suryakumar Yadav, Saurabh Tiwary, Hardik Pandya, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Piyush Chawla/Jayant Yadav, Rahul Chahar, Trent Boult, Jasprit Bumrah

Royal Challengers Bangalore: Devdutt Padikkal has resumed training and could be available for the opening match. Kane Richardson and Adam Zampa are unlikely to be available for selection. The number five slot could be up for grabs for one of the three uncapped Indian players. Shahbaz Ahmed could also be in contention.

B6$ Devdutt Padikkal, Virat Kohli (c), Glenn Maxwell, AB de Villiers, Mohammad Azharuddin/Rajat Patidar, Daniel Christian, Washington Sundar, Kyle Jamieson, Navdeep Saini, Mohammad Siraj, Yuzvendra Chahal.

Did you know?

Royal Challengers Bangalore’s 37.04 percent success rate against Mumbai Indians is the second worst for them against any team. The worst is against Chennai Super Kings (34.62)

Barring Yuzvendra Chahal, none of the RCB spinners have played an IPL game in Chennai. The leggie's economy rate of 5.25, fairly higher than Mumbai’s spin duo of Krunal (4.00) and Chahar (4.38).

Mumbai Indians’ top order has a low scoring rate in Chennai. Ishan Kishan (90.32), Rohit Sharma (119.69) and Suryakumar Yadav (108.75) would look to better on that pace.

What they said:


""Having done well last year in such a competitive scenario and space, we're very confident that as a side, with a stronger squad this time around, we'll have another great season. Just playing in set venues with four teams, I think that's going to nullify all the home advantage that every team used to have."" - Virat Kohli, RCB skipper.
Squads:

2021,T20 League,Indian Premier League,1st Match,T20 IPL,35612,Royal Challengers Bangalore,N/A,Royal Challengers Bangalore have won the toss and have opted to field,1,120,19.6,"Welcome back! Virat Kohli is back at the top for RCB and it's gonna be Washington Sundar who will open alongside him. Trent Boult to kickstart proceedings with the ball. Two slips in place. Off we go...
Harshal: Ball started tailing a bit when I came into bowl the 16th over, that was my cue. And I executed brilliantly. You can't look at the opposition all the time. All you need to focus on at the top of your mark is your execution and planning and that's what I did. It was very clear from the beginning I was going to bowl two overs at the death but today I bowled three. Feels great. This is my first five-wicket haul in all the T20s I've played. Coming against MI it feels special. It's a decent batting surface. Just the dimensions allow you to take pace off. Also the bounce isn't as good as it usually is. It's probably keeping low. But I don't think it's a two paced wicket.
21:21 Local Time, 15:51 GMT, 21:21 IST: Stunning last over from Harshal Patel. Three wickets and just one run. What a squeeze this is from RCB. MI were 86/1 in 10 overs and SKY was looking dangerous. RCB didn't have renowned names for the death overs, but they have kept Rohit and Co. to under 160 and Kohli is extremely happy. 73/8 in the last 10 overs against a side like MI is not a joke. Credit to Kohli for his smart captaincy. Got Jamieson back on to get Surya, introduced Sundar to get Lynn. Siraj bowled a very good wicketless spell. And then Harshal Patel stole the show. Almost got a hat-trick as he recorded his best IPL figures. Kohli got hit under his right eye missing a catch. It turned red and he walked off the field after the innings with an icepack. RCB will back themselves to chase this down. MI will pray for the dew to be absent today. Chase coming up shortly.

Harshal Patel to Bumrah, no run, now he almost gets a sixth with an inswinging yorker, Bumrah couldn't squeeze it. Ball was just outside off stump, AB threw the ball onto the sticks, ball ricochets and decide against stealing run
Jasprit Bumrah, right handed bat, comes to the crease
19.4
Harshal Patel to Marco Jansen, out Bowled!! One ball later but he has a five-wicket haul. Harshal Patel with an inswinging yorker that smashes the sticks. Wow! Kohli is delighted.

Harshal Patel to Pollard, out Caught by Washington Sundar!! Make that four for Harshal Patel. What an outing. Pollard is unable to pick any change of pace today. Played the slog early, ball came slow and ended up playing with one hand. Bat turns on impact and ball goes straight to deep backward square leg to make it the best bowling figures for Harshal Patel in IPL. He's on a hat-trick too.

Harshal Patel to Krunal Pandya, out Caught by Christian!! The shot looked stylish but style doesn't always work. Stayed leg-side of the ball, didn't bother to move his feet and just used his wrists to whip that ball for six than open the front leg and slog conventional way. The ball went high over mid-wicket and Christian was calm on the fence. Three for Harshal Patel. Krunal Pandya c Christian b Harshal Patel 7(7) [4s-1]
Harshal Patel to Krunal Pandya, THATS OUT!! Caught!!

Jamieson to Pollard, FOUR, top edge and Pollard gets lucky! The ball clears the keeper. Short slower delivery into the wicket, Pollard plays the pull early, got a thick enough edge to get the desired boundary. Kohli applauds his bowler because that wasn't the bowler's fault
18.4
Jamieson to Krunal Pandya, 1 run, slower delivery on the stumps, Pandya pulls it to deep square leg
18.3
Jamieson to Krunal Pandya, no run, brilliant yorker and the bat is in two pieces. Pandya swung, the handle is in the hands, but the rest of the willow broke and fell to ground. Proud moment for a bowler. Krunal sees the funny side of it
18.3
Jamieson to Krunal Pandya, no ball, FOUR, short and on the stumps, Pandya pulls, not from the middle of the bat, but in the gap between deep backward square leg and deep mid-wicket. Oh he's overstepped. Will be a free-hit
18.2
Jamieson to Pollard, 1 run, mistimed pull on the bounce to deep mid-wicket
18.1
Jamieson to Krunal Pandya, 1 run, dropped! But is Kohli okay? Looks like the ball burst through his hands and hit him on the face. Thankfully just under his right eye. Was too casual for the catch. He switches position but doesn't go off. Brings out the smile to the relief of the RCB fans. So this was a full ball in the slot, Pandya smashed it hard. Kohli moved to the left, tried to go reverse cup style and spilled the catch
Kyle Jamieson [3.0-0-15-1] is back into the attack

Harshal Patel to Ishan Kishan, out Lbw!! One of those rare errors from Nitin. He thought the ball pitched outside leg, but the replay confirms it was in line with leg stump. Kishan going too far across the line to play that stylish bottom hand whip, misses the ball completely, impact in line with middle and smashing the poles. Harshal Patel was surprised the decision wasn't given and immediately showed the thums up to his captain to say that was out. Good review from RCB. Ishan Kishan lbw b Harshal Patel 28(19) [4s-2 6s-1]
Harshal Patel to Ishan Kishan, THATS OUT!! Lbw!!
LBW check but. Looked OUT but not given. Looks like Kishan is in trouble. GONE!
17.3
Harshal Patel to Ishan Kishan, 2 runs, now Siraj has dropped a sitter. Harshal Patel digs this slower ball short and into the wicket, Kishan pulls and gets a top edge, straight around hip height for Siraj at deep backward square leg but he was too soft on the hands and it popped out. Hides his face
17.2
Harshal Patel to Pollard, 1 run, Pollard swings hard, but swings early as Harshal Patel takes pace off. Rolls to mid-wicket
So Jamieson and Christian to close out
17.1
Harshal Patel to Pollard, no run, short of length delivery outside off stump, Pollard punches to the left of the bowler
Just 7 runs off it with a wide. Should have had a wicket and that boundary saved too. Siraj ends with an impressive 4-0-22-0.

16.3
Siraj to Pollard, no run, big Polly won't like that! Siraj bowls a short delivery, Pollard tries to baack away and gets hit on the right chest. That must have woken him up surely

Siraj to Ishan Kishan, 1 run, low full toss, Kishan flicks it to fine leg
16.1
Siraj to Ishan Kishan, FOUR, what have you done, Washi? Look away from Siraj. He's staring! This should have been an easy swallow at deep backward square leg had he been near the rope. Was a few yards inside and in the end had to jump, didn't touch the ball and what's worse, the ball bounced inside the rope. Siraj had every reason to be angry. Kishan creamed that pull short off this short ball, thought he was gone but what a great escape
16.1
Siraj to Ishan Kishan, wide, nope! A ball down leg side will have to be rebowled
Mohammed Siraj [3.0-0-15-0] is back into the attack
Kieron Pollard, right handed bat, comes to the crease
Time-out. The elation on Kohli's face says it. This could make a difference of 10 runs to the total, but MI never run out of batters. It's a very interesting middle phase that happened. Runs, smart moves and wickets. 170 is a very good total on this up and down pitch. Can RCB close out the overs well?

Pandya played for normal pace and fell over slightly trying the flick, the ball came slow and the impact was in line with leg stump. Hardik was across the stumps to make like easy for umpire Nitin Menon, but you don't need external help if you are Nitin Menon. Been top class with his umpiring.

Washington Sundar to Chris Lynn, out Caught&Bowled!! Another master move by Kohli! He's been smart with his bowling changes and there's no set pattern for the opponents to expect. Washi gets turns from his home pitch and Lynn miscued the slog completely. looked like it hit him on the outside half and sligjtly high too. Washi knew there was no mid-on or mid-wicket. so raced back from his bowling crease, judged it really well and took it over his shoulders. A good debut for Lynn. Had to dig deep after running the captain out. Chris Lynn c and b Washington Sundar 49(35) [4s-4 6s-3]

Siraj to Chris Lynn, 1 run, in the airrrr and just short of Jamieson. If Jamieson can't get there, no one in this RCB line-up can. Pace off and into the pitch again, good variation from Siraj, Lynn toe-ends the slap towards mid-off, who runs and dives. Doesn't get there
11.4
Siraj to Chris Lynn, no run, oh beat him for pace! An Indian pacer beats a bloke who plays at the Gabba for pace on a sluggish pitch! Wow! Fullish and outside off stump, Lynn was late in coming forward, lucky didn't edge this to ABdV
11.3
Siraj to Ishan Kishan, 1 run, tucked through backward square leg as Siraj rushes Kishan with a short of length delivery

Jamieson to Suryakumar Yadav, out Caught by de Villiers!! Wow! He's got him and what a move by Kohli! Two overs left off Jamieson but he was smart to use one of them now. If the surface is slow, pace off and into the wicket works. Jamieson gets a bit of bounce too, SKY had to delay the upper cut and that put his balance off a wee bit, which is why he outside-edged this to the keeper. Delight for Kohli and RCB. The set and ominous looking Surya walks back. Jamieson opens his wickets column in the IPL. Suryakumar Yadav c de Villiers b Jamieson 31(23) [4s-4 6s-1]
Jamieson to Suryakumar Yadav, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
10.5
Jamieson to Suryakumar Yadav, no run, good comeback from Jamieson. Bowls back of a length and outside off stump, tough length to hit on sluggish surfaces. SKY slashes and misses
10.4
Jamieson to Suryakumar Yadav, SIX, that's it! That the zone. Jamieson feeding a leg stump ball on length, SKY loves to use his wrists, flicks it aerial and doesn't mind the fielder in the deep. Clears quite comfortably
10.3
Jamieson to Suryakumar Yadav, no run, oh what happened there? SKY playing too far across the line, wanted to send this hack through square leg than mid-wicket, misses and the ball brushes the thigh pad en route to ABdV

Time out! If you were worried Rohit's run out was going to weigh on Lynn, that fear has been bashed out pretty quick. The pitch didn't initially look like it had a run-fest in it, but Lynn and now Suryakumar have got the boundaries flowing. Dangerous times for RCB.

Chahal to Chris Lynn, out Rohit Run Out!! A mix-up out there, and Rohit's gone! Oh dear. He was really keen for the single, but from halfway down Lynn sends him back. It's too late. Slightly short ball just outside off, Lynn mistimes the cut in between two fielders at cover and cover-point. He takes a couple of steps initially, which really sets Rohit off. But then Lynn backs out. And with Kohli swooping onto the ball, there's no getting back. Massive blow. Will it weigh on Lynn now? Rohit run out (Kohli/Chahal) 19(15) [4s-1 6s-1]

Chahal to Rohit, SIX, oh this is delightful from Rohit. Flighted up from Chahal, and the footwork from the MI captain to get to the ball is what makes this shot. Dances down, just chips it through the line over mid-on and the timing is such that it's gone all the way

2021,T20 League,Indian Premier League,1st Match,T20 IPL,35612,Royal Challengers Bangalore,N/A,Royal Challengers Bangalore have won the toss and have opted to field,2,120,19.6,"It may have gone to the last ball, it may have been a proper thriller, but this was far from being a good game for either side. And in the end it was about who messed up more. But RCB should be proud, they've corrected a massive historic weakness in their death bowling tonight. Mumbai couldn't care less. Winning tonight would've felt strange. This was their warm-up match. They haven't turned up yet.Their IPL has only a 13-match league stage. Okay, it was fun bringing you this, as I, Vineet Anantharaman, sign off on behalf of Sagar Chawla, Raju Peethala, Ramakrishnan MS and our scorer, Mukesh Gowda. Until tomorrow, when Dhoni definitely shows up, ta ta!!
Harshal Patel | MoM: Absolutely happy to be back. When they traded me they told me my role was going to be bowling in the death and that is something that I have worked on for a couple of years. Happy to be here and with the faith they have shown in me. I was just focussed on my execution and the most important thing was to make use of my momentum. It is my first fifer in 98 T20s and the fact that it has come against MI makes it all the more special. I have worked a lot on my yorker. I was always good at the length balls ans slower balls. I wanted to be a bowler who takes on responsibility and that's what I have been working on for the last few years.
Virat Kohli | Winning captain: We won the first match last year as well that we played. It was important to play against the strongest side in the competition and test our side. Everyone was involved in this game, and when you win by two wickets, it means that everyone has gone in and played. A lot of options for me as well that helped bringing the game back. The pitch was looking decent in the first half, but to be honest, with the old ball the length ball was difficult to get away. That is why those partnerships between Maxi and me and then between AB and Maxi was really important. It's not a pitch where you can just hit through the line. You have to be smart with picking the gaps and running hard. Playing in Chennai you have to be respectful of that. The shot that Pollard got out to, in Wankhde it would've sailed into the crowds. We came back well and used the conditions well. They came back well too after losing Rohit early and those last six overs for us were probably the best six we've ever had. We brought Harshal in a trade from Delhi. He is relishing the responsibility and is clear with his plans. He was the difference today. He is going to be our death bowler. As a captain you want players with clarity, and he has that. Jamieson started off well, Yuzi was good, Siraj was good too. In T20 cricket, clarity at the top of your mark is all you as for as a captain. Harshal was very clear with that and it was his day today. We wanted Maxi to bat at four. Rajat is a very solid players. He is an exciting player, plays spin well too. The thinking was that we wanted to give Maxi some balls at the start and not get him slogging rightaway. You saw the result today of him playing 10-15 balls. His innings was the game-changer. Had he stayed in we would've finished a couple of overs earlier. The opposition then gets nervous about AB. We have depth in the batting which we want to utilize. AB is probably the only one in the team who is so versatile. And he does it on slow wickets what not many can do. In a tricky chase you need experience at the back, and the opposition knows that if he doesn't get out, the bowlers get in a different headspace.
AB de Villiers: Was an incredible game of cricket. We knew it wasn't going to be easy, we knew it wasn't an easy pitch to play on and it's one of those wickets that gets harder as the game goes on and we knew if we could take it to the end we could take a chance. It was a good throw (about his run-out) and Krunal was spot-on. Absolute pleasure playing alongside him (Maxwell). I love playing with players like that and he just wants to win cricket games. And also there's Dan Christian. It's a nice combination to have. There's a reason why they've won the trophy five times but that was the challenge for us tonight. We did well and we won the first game against them last year as well.
Rohit Sharma | Losing captain: That's the most important thing I guess (to win tournaments). Not the first game. I thought it was a great effort.. great fight till the end. I thought we were 20 runs short with the kind of start we got. We made some mistakes in the first game, bound to happen. He's (Jansen) a talent we have identified to bowl in any situation. We wanted to get wickets when AB and Christian were batting, which is why we went with Bumrah and Boult, unfortunately it didn't work. Definitely not an easy pitch to bat on. We need to identify the situations and get variations. AB was brilliant and got them home. In hindsight you can say it takes time to get intensity. But there are fresh faces. Lot of players were playing international cricket and we have not had time to get to know each other very well. It can be difficult for teams who have great home record but that's the challenge of the sport (about playing in neutral venues). But we are fortunate enough to be able to be on the park and put some smiles on the faces of people in India. The country is going through tough times. Give them something to look forward to.
STAT: First time RCB have won a season opener they have been involved in. They lost in 2008, 2017 & 2019.
RCB winning off the last ball in run chases (IPL)
vs PWI Bengaluru 2012
vs MI Mumbai 2021
23:25 Local Time: Some things in life never change. L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L.L. And however close Mumbai manage to drag it, history continues to defy them. Also, just as fittingly, it's Harshal Patel with this winning flick, making sure he does no wrong on what's already been a massively satisfying day with his fifer. This match really had no business getting this close. With Kohli and Maxwell having laid the platform, and then with AB smoking them around, this really looked over at the second time-out. But again, Bumrah's Bumrah for a reason. Picking up wickets is one thing, but keeping AB off strike is another. And he did both. But still, RCB's choking wasn't all that good! For all that they fought with at the death with the ball, it was their batting at the death that was actually the clincher. When you end up with figures of 39 runs | 6 wickets in overs 15-20, you rarely win. And when it's Mumbai and their history of IPL openers, you just cannot win. Okay stick around, the presentations are here ..

AB - in his greed to keep his strike - quite deliberately nurdles this very softly through mid-wicket, and despite Krunal Pandya getting to the ball by the time he was turning around for the second, he doesn't stop. He takes the risk. And even his full-length dive cannot get him in. de Villiers run out (Krunal Pandya/Ishan Kishan) 48(27) [4s-4 6s-2]

Bumrah to Jamieson, 3 runs, 143.7kph, has a massive swing across the line, and gets an inside-edge for all his efforts, rolling away to fine leg, where Janses first runs to it, tumbles, keeps it out, and then Boult backs up and dives to stop it from rolling over further
16.4
Bumrah to Jamieson, no run, nipping in on middle, length, tight. Jabbed away to leg
Kyle Jamieson, right handed bat, comes to the crease
16.3
Bumrah to Christian, out Caught by Rahul Chahar!! 138.3kph. Back of a length, quick, wide and enticing Christian to slap. Oh, he does. And he doesn't keep it down either, with Chahar - the point man - doing well to intercept towards his right. Who's even surprised? Christian c Rahul Chahar b Bumrah 1(3)
Bumrah to Christian, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
16.2
Bumrah to Christian, no run, 145.1kph, another proper mother of yorkers. It's an achievement when you don't end up bowled on these. Christian digs it out
16.1
Bumrah to de Villiers, 1 run, 131.5kph, leg-lined yorker. AB toe-ends the squeeze in front of mid-off. Okay, Mumbai wanted exactly this ..
Jasprit Bumrah [2.0-0-9-1] is back into the attack
Okay, time-out. 39 runs | 24 balls. It's still properly RCB's to lose, especially with AB out there and looking measured. But this is where Mumbai do what they do, turn to Bumrah, sit back, and watch teams just crumble.

Rahul Chahar to de Villiers, 1 run, looks to paddle, but misses and Kishan cops a blow on his helmet

Marco Jansen to Shahbaz Ahmed, out Caught by Krunal Pandya!! And after a very nervous first over, Jansen's suddenly turning tables here. He does it with a pretty full length, into the body, but Chepauk makes it stay low, and gets Ahmed to crouch in adjustment as he heaves, top-edges and gets it down deep square leg's throat. Shahbaz Ahmed c Krunal Pandya b Marco Jansen 1(2)
Marco Jansen to Shahbaz Ahmed, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
14.5
Marco Jansen to de Villiers, 1 run, 136kph, quite a wild swing outside off, hoping to get it over cover, but no, ends up getting a thick outside edge running down to third man
14.4
Marco Jansen to de Villiers, no run, 133.3kph, proper yorker, tailing in on leg-stump. Somehow, somehow jammed out to leg
The equation: 5 Half-Nelsons | 3 Half-Nelsons
14.3
Marco Jansen to de Villiers, no run, 134.2kph, tight stuff -- length, on middle, zero room. AB looks to cut, but can only drag it down the pitch

Marco Jansen to Shahbaz Ahmed, wide, full, angling in, and continues angling down leg

Marco Jansen to Maxwell, out Caught by Chris Lynn!! Now, now. RCB are slipping into a familiar collapse. It's really a nice sitter when seen in isolation from Jansen -- short, around the chest, slow. But Maxwell's misread the pace big time, almost finishing going through his pull by the time the ball gets to him. And hence, the mistime off the bat' sticker dipping in front of short fine leg, where Lynn dives under just in time. Maxwell c Chris Lynn b Marco Jansen 39(28) [4s-3 6s-2]
Marco Jansen to Maxwell, THATS OUT!! Caught!!
Marco Jansen [2.0-0-19-0] is back into the attack

Bumrah to Kohli, out Lbw!! Shuffles far too across, gets beaten for pace, and misses a pretty straight delivery to get struck on the front knee roll in front of middle. So this is what Mumbai do -- turn to Bumrah, and sit back. He does it with the wobbly-seamer. Kohli lbw b Bumrah 33(29) [4s-4]

Rahul Chahar to Kohli, 1 run, short, flatter, wider, stabbed through point
11.4
Rahul Chahar to Kohli, no run, proper drag down this. But somehow, Kohli's missed it. Blame the lack of bounce, sneaking under his bat, with some sharp spin on it as well to get it wide of off-stump
11.3
Rahul Chahar to Kohli, 2 runs, serious miscue ., but landing right in between three converging fielders. So Kohli dances down, Chahar slows it up, Kohli swings, Chahar draws the toe-end, but it floats up and falls well past Pollard running back from mid-off
11.2
Rahul Chahar to Maxwell, 1 run, loopy, full, on middle, shoved out to long-off
11.1
Rahul Chahar to Maxwell, SIX, reverse-slogs, top-edges, but as if that ever mattered with Maxwell. It's a leg-break outside leg-stump, and there is a deep point. But again, as if that ever mattered with Maxwell ..
